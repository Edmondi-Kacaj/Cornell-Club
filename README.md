# How to use?
## Dev Env
1. Clone.
2. Run  ``` npm install ```.
3. Run ```npm start``` . Local server runs on Port 3000
4. ```src/webData.js``` provides some API which can be loaded into pages. Not all data are included in it. TBD someday MAYBE.

## Product Env
1. Run ``` npm run build ```.
2. You can see some in the console.  
** The build folder is ready to be deployed.
You may serve it with a static server:**
```  npm install -g serve ```  
```  serve -s build ```  
You can see the web app generated then.
3. If everything goes right, you can deploy it on a server with Nginx or Apache.
4.
